## Local Development / Setup Instructions

### Install Node.js and Package Manager

Before you start, ensure you have Node.js and a package manager installed on your machine. Follow these steps:

1. **Download Node.js**:

   - Visit the [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/).
   - Download the v20.18.0 version. This was the latest LTS version when the project was created.
   - Follow the installation instructions provided on the website.

2. **Verify Installation**:

   - Open your terminal or command prompt.
   - Run the following command to check if Node.js is installed:
     ```bash
     node -v
     ```
   - You should see the version number of Node.js.

3. **Install a Package Manager**:

   - Node.js comes with npm (Node Package Manager) by default. To check if npm is installed, run:
     ```bash
     npm -v
     ```
   - Alternatively, you can use other package managers like Yarn or pnpm.

4. **Run the Development Server**:

   - Once Node.js and a package manager are installed, you can start the development server:

     ```bash
     npm run dev
     # or
     yarn dev
     # or
     pnpm dev
     ```

   - Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

### Introduction

This project is a fork of [pyconfhyd2025](https://github.com/HydPy/pyconfhyd2025), initially developed as a **modular conference website** featuring reusable components. To learn more, refer to the [introduction section of pyconfhyd2025](https://github.com/HydPy/pyconfhyd2025?tab=readme-ov-file#introduction).

A feature flag configuration has been introduced, enabling a gradual rollout of features. Check out the [PyConf 2026 setup PR](https://github.com/HydPy/pyconfhyd2026/pull/1) to see how changes can be made when setting up the conference website.

This year's focus is on improving the template while seamlessly integrating it with [HydPy's website](https://www.hydpy.org/) by redirecting selected pages to the main site.
